```rust
// This is a Rust code block

fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```

And this is an intervening paragraph.

```c
// This is a C code block

#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    printf("Hello, world!\n");
}
```

And this is another intervening paragraph.

```
This is a code block but without
any syntax highlighting.

Just to try it.
```

There is a break right here\
and this is the rest of the line.

Numbered list:

1. Number 1
2. Number 2
3. Number 3

Unnumbered list:

* Unnumbered list 1
* Unnumbered list 2
* Unnumbered list 3

Loose unnumbered list:

* Unnumbered list 1

  And a second paragraph for 1

* Unnumbered list 2

  And a second paragraph for 2

* Unnumbered list 3

  And a second paragraph for 3

And some nesting:

* Outer 1
  * Inner 1.1
  * Inner 1.2
    * Inner 1.2.1
    * Inner 1.2.2
  * Inner 1.3
* Outer 2
  * Inner 2.1
  * Inner 2.1

And mixing:

* Outer bullet 1
  1. Inner numbered!
     * Inner inner bullet!
  2. Inner numbered 2!
* Outer bullet 2

A table:

|Left header   |Center Header |  Right header|None header   |
|:-------------|:------------:|-------------:|--------------|
|12345678901234|ABCDEFGHIJKLMN|ABCDEFGHIJKLMN|12345678901234|
|`123`         |    `ABC`     |         `DEF`|`456`         |
|*123*         |    *ABC*     |         *DEF*|*456*         |
|**123**       |   **ABC**    |       **DEF**|**456**       |

This paragraph uses embedded typst to make this next word
#strong[strong].

And a closing paragraph.

# Header 1

And more embedded Typst to make this: #lorem(30) 

#lorem(30)

## Header 2

#lorem(30)

### Header 3

#lorem(30)

#### Header 4

#lorem(30)

##### Header 5

#lorem(30)

###### Header 6

#lorem(30)
